    <p>The Octopus (plural Octopuses) is a soft-bodied, eight limbed mollusc of the order Octopoda. Around 300 species are recognized, and the order is grouped within the class Cephalopoda with squids, cuttlefish, and nautiloids. Octopuses are bilaterally symmetric with two eyes and a beak, with its mouth at the center point of the eight limbs. Their soft body enables them to squeeze through any small gap their beak can fit through. Octopuses have a complex nervous system and excellent sight, and are among the most intelligent and behaviourally diverse of all invertebrates.</p>
